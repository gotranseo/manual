# Workflow
This workflow is mostly engineering-specific, but can also be applied to other departments as well. 

## Sprints
We work in 2 week sprints meaning that at the beginning of each 2 week cycle we define the work that will get completed over the next two weeks. There are a few main benefits to this method, the most importance of which is avoiding [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep). This helps us focus on what's important for those two weeks, and gives us a hard deadline to work towards in terms of deliverables.

Sprints look different for different products, so the most important thing is to make sure that you are coordinating with your team around scope selection and ensuring that deadlines can be met on all of the items in the sprint. 

Here's the bottom line - although we'd love to pretend that sprints work perfectly and solve all of the problems in development cycles, stuff happens. So if something that was originally in the sprint just can't be done, work with the head of your team to move it into the next sprint as early as possible. 

## Standups
Standups happen every day via Slack. As a remote team, we acknowledge that we don't have nearly as much control over our team member's day-to-day schedule as we would if we were working in person. That being said, we won't force you to give a standup report at a specific time every day, we only ask that you send a message to the head of your team on your own time at some point in the morning reflecting on what you did the day prior, and what lessons you are going to take into today. 

## Retros
Retrospectives, or "retros" for short, happen at the end of the day on Fridays at the end of a 2 week sprint. This is an opportunity for all of Transeo development to get together and share what went well, what went wrong, and what we can do to improve going forward. This helps focus us for the future while also acknowledging the lessons we learned from the previous sprint, with the goal being to make development more efficient and productive going forward.
